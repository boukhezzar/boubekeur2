abstract: In this paper, a review about gain scheduling (GS) is presented, with a
  special focus on the classical GS approach and the linear parameter varying (LPV)
  approach. The main definitions are given. A brief overview of stability and performance
  is stated. More recent results are gathered. Finally, a simulation example on a
  rotational link is presented, comparing two different techniques of gain scheduling,
  showing that gain-scheduled LPV state feedback actually achieves better performance
  over a much wide operating range than classical gain scheduling.
