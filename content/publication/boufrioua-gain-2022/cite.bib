 abstract = {In this paper, a review about gain scheduling (GS) is presented, with a special focus on the classical GS approach and the linear parameter varying (LPV) approach. The main definitions are given. A brief overview of stability and performance is stated. More recent results are gathered. Finally, a simulation example on a rotational link is presented, comparing two different techniques of gain scheduling, showing that gain-scheduled LPV state feedback actually achieves better performance over a much wide operating range than classical gain scheduling.},
