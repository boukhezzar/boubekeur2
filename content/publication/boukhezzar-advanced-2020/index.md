abstract: 'In this work, a complete remote lab for automatic control is designed and
  implemented with many experiments. It allows remote users to do physical experiment
  and instructors to personalize their experiments and evaluate the remote students.  The
  remote lab is composed of software and hardware devices : The iLab (internet Laboratory)
  environment is used as a deployment platform for our Remote Lab. It is installed
  on a server machine at Constantine 1 university, Algeria. It is compatible with
  LabVIEW and web browsers. The remote end-user needs only a web-browser and an installed
  plug-in to access to all the Remote Lab physical experiments via a GUI.   Many experimental
  setups are mounted. They give a practical aspect to theorical course followed by
  the students. The implemented control strategies are : 1. Optimal control, 2. Polynomial
  control, 3. State space control.  A classical PI/PID control strategy is added to
  serve as reference for comparison. Once logged, the user can choose an experiment
  and ask for a reservation time to lead the experiment. The user can then launch
  the experiment directly from its web-browser. At the end of the experiment, all
  the data generated during it are stored in the server. The data can be downloaded
  by the user and the instructor for analysis and evaluation. The instructor can also
  consult a journal including students connections history.'
