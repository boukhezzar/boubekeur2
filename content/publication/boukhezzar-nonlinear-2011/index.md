abstract: The paper presents a nonlinear approach, using a two-mass model and a wind
  speed estimator, for variable-speed wind turbine (WT) control. The use of a two-mass
  model is motivated by the need to deal with flexible modes induced by the low-speed
  shaft stiffness. The main objective of the proposed controllers is the wind power
  capture optimization while limiting transient loads on the drive-train components.
  This paper starts by an adaptation of some existing control strategies. However,
  their performance are weak, as the dynamics aspects of the wind and aeroturbine
  are not taken into consideration. In order to bring some improvements, nonlinear
  static and dynamic state feedback controllers, with a wind speed estimator, are
  then proposed. Concerning the wind speed estimator, the idea behind this is to exploit
  the WT dynamics by itself as a measurement device. All these methods have been first
  tested and validated using an aeroelastic WT simulator. A comparative study between
  the proposed controllers is performed. The results show better performance for the
  nonlinear dynamic controller with estimator in comparison with the adapted existing
  methods.
