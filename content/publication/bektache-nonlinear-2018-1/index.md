abstract: A nonlinear predictive controller is proposed for a variable speed wind
  turbine. The objective is power capture optimization and transient loads reduction.
  The controller acts only on low wind speed area. It consists of a doubly fed induction
  generator controller coupled with a model predictive aeroturbine controller. Unlike
  the majority of existing work on DFIG, the nonlinear controller deals directly with
  the generator model without any simplifying assumptions. This makes it possible
  to remove some assumptions on the DFIG model. The nonlinear DFIG controller achieves
  asymptotic torque and flux tracking. For the aeroturbine part, the model predictive
  controller uses predictions of the output to compute the optimal control sequence.
  It makes a compromise between power capture optimization and loads reduction. The
  controllers design procedure is detailed. The global controller is tested with the
  parameters of a real experimental variable speed wind turbine. It is compared with
  PID and LQG controllers. The simulations show satisfactory results in comparison
  with these schemes. The proposed controller achieves better power capture optimization
  and load reduction. It therefore allows a good achievement of the design objectives.
