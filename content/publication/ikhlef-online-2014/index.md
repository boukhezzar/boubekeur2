abstract: In this paper, a remote temperature control system has been proposed. The
  physical system is controlled in real time through the Internet network. For educational
  purpose, the students use only a web browser to tune and test a PID controller via
  shared user interface. The PID parameters are calculated using the basic experimental
  Ziegler-Nichols tuning rules. After hardware and software experiment description,
  the remote online experiment is tested and the results are given.
