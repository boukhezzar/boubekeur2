abstract: Wind turbine torque control strategy is commonly used to maximize energy
  in low wind speed operating. One of the main limitations of wind turbine control
  is wind fluctuations, in order to solve this problem, the present article represents
  a fuzzy gain scheduling of PI gains (FGSPI) for torque control based on tip-speed
  ratio (TSR) method. This technique consists in choosing the optimal gains by using
  human expertise based on fuzzy rules. Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART)
  based on the Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence (FAST) simulator
  developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States
  is used for simulations. The results show that the proposed method performs well
  compared to the conventional method with better monitoring of the reference speed
  and load mitigation.
