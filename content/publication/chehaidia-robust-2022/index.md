abstract: Power maximization and fatigue alleviation are essential for variable speed
  wind turbines operating in partial load zone. It is within this framework that the
  present paper gives a global state of art of the application of sliding mode control
  (SMC) for wind turbines and proposes a new application of Terminal Integral Sliding
  Mode Control (TISMC) for variable speed wind turbines, described as a mechatronic
  system, represented by uncertain lumped mass dynamics. In order to represent a relatively
  exhaustive study, a stability proof is also synthesized and verified using the Lyapunov
  criterion. In order to evaluate the proposed solution, a numerical validation has
  been done on Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART 2) using the National Renewable
  Energy Laboratory (NREL) simulator Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence
  (FAST). For more accuracy 9 DOFs (Degrees of Freedom) were enabled with a realistic
  turbulent wind field. The obtained results shown the effectiveness of TISMC compared
  to some existing linear and nonlinear controllers in term of output power maximization
  and loads mitigation.
