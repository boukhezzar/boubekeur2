 abstract = {Wind energy is a promising energy vector, attracting the consideration of industrialists and scientists in the light of the current energetic-environmental challenges. Hence the need to develop control laws to extract maximum profit from wind turbines. In this context the following paper addresses the problem of wind turbine power limitation in full load region using a novel supervised fuzzy PI pitch angle control. The proposed controller schedule proportional and integral gains based on real-time measurement of pitch angle and its rate. The proposed control has been validated on Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART) using Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence (FAST) simulator by considering 9 DOFs. The obtained results confirm that the proposed control law provides better power and speed regulation with best load reduction and damping to the flexible modes of wind turbine than baseline PI pitch controller.},
