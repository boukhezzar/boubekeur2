abstract: Wind energy is a promising energy vector, attracting the consideration of
  industrialists and scientists in the light of the current energetic-environmental
  challenges. Hence the need to develop control laws to extract maximum profit from
  wind turbines. In this context the following paper addresses the problem of wind
  turbine power limitation in full load region using a novel supervised fuzzy PI pitch
  angle control. The proposed controller schedule proportional and integral gains
  based on real-time measurement of pitch angle and its rate. The proposed control
  has been validated on Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART) using Fatigue, Aerodynamics,
  Structures and Turbulence (FAST) simulator by considering 9 DOFs. The obtained results
  confirm that the proposed control law provides better power and speed regulation
  with best load reduction and damping to the flexible modes of wind turbine than
  baseline PI pitch controller.
