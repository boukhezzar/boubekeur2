abstract: The purpose of this work is to compare some linear and nonlinear control
  strategies, with the aim of benefiting as well as possible of wind energy conversion
  systems. Below rated wind speed, the main control objective is to perform an optimal
  wind power capture while avoiding strong loads on the drive train shafts. To explicitly
  take into consideration the low speed shaft flexibility, a two-mass nonlinear model
  of the wind turbine is used for controllers synthesis. After adapting a LQG controller
  based on the linearized model, nonlinear controllers based on a wind speed estimator
  are developed. They take into account the nonlinear dynamic aspect of the wind turbine
  and the turbulent nature of the wind. The controllers are validated upon an aeroelastic
  wind turbine simulator for a realistic wind speed profile. The study shows that
  nonlinear control strategies bring more performance in the exploitation of wind
  energy conversion systems.
